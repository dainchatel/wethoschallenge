## Wethos Front End Code Challenge

#Process
I used Create-React-App to bootstrap a new React project, then recreated a layout with specific assets. 

The final layout reflects a compromise between the assets that were provided (font, new logo) and the desired layout. The header fonts have been updated, and the highlight color has been changed from red to purple, to more closely match the new logo. Since it's attached to a SCSS variable, the color can quickly be changed throughout the document. 

I also used Flexbox and React-View-Slider to add functionality and responsive styles. 

For simplicity, I put breakpoints at 950px and 650px. In the future, these breakpoints can be updated so they cover more devices. 

#Deployment
The project is deployed [here]().
