# Wethos Front End Code Challenge
## Dain Chatel

## Process
I used Create-React-App to bootstrap a new React project, then recreated a layout with specific assets. 

I compromised between the assets that were provided (font, new logo) and the desired layout. I used the new font and changed the highlight color from red to purple, to match the new logo. 

The images provided did not correspond with those in the mockup, so they don't necessarily match their content. Otherwise I used placeholder images. 

I also used Sass, Flexbox, and [React-View-Slider](https://github.com/jcoreio/react-view-slider) to add functionality and responsive styles. I used the [chokidar node-sass](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-sass-chokidar/) library to compile on the go. 

For simplicity, I put breakpoints at 950px and 650px. In the future, these breakpoints can be updated so they cover more devices. 

## Deployment
The project is deployed [here](http://dain-chatel-wethos-challenge.bitballoon.com/).
