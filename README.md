# Wethos Front End Code Challenge
## Dain Chatel

## Process
I used Create-React-App to bootstrap a new React project, then recreated a layout with specific assets. 

I compromised between the assets that were provided (font, new logo) and the desired layout. I used the new font and changed the highlight color from red to purple, to match the new logo. 

I also used Sass, Flexbox and React-View-Slider to add functionality and responsive styles. 

For simplicity, I put breakpoints at 950px and 650px. In the future, these breakpoints can be updated so they cover more devices. 

#Deployment
The project is deployed [here]().
